# pathfinder

## Setup

The aim of this code is to compare various path finding algorithms. The purpose of each of the files is as follows:

1. **maze.py** - It has the class Maze which constructs the maze in which the search algorithms will work
2. **createMaze.py** - It provides a visual representation of how the maze is constructed using depth first search

## Result
